#### DESCRIPTION

As a young boy, I remember taking my first steps in programming with the help of the Commodore64 and its language Basic. The device opened up a whole new world of possibilities and I spent countless hours tinkering with it, learning about programming concepts and exploring the limits of what was possible back then.

A couple of years later I was introduced to one of my favorite video games, Resident Evil. The game captivated me with its breathtaking storyline and innovative gameplay mechanics. As I jumped deeper into the world of programming, I began to dream of creating my own game, one that would rival even the great Resident Evil (My second dream is to work for Capcom ;-).

From the moment I started learning the programming language C, I knew that it was the language for me. Despite its challenges, I find it to be a fascinating and powerful language. There's something about working with C that makes me feel like I am getting closer to the core of the computer's memory and the binary system.

While I had some experience with C#'s syntax and structure, C has quickly become my language of choice. I appreciate the level of control it offers and how it allows me to write efficient and performant code. But, as much as I love C, I also recognize that there are limitations to what I can do with it, especially when it comes to developing complex, feature-rich applications.

That's why I'm now eager to take my skills to the next level and learn C++. As someone who aspires to become a game developer at a top-tier publisher, I know that I need to be proficient in multiple programming languages. C++ is a language that is widely used in the game development industry and is essential for creating high-performance games.

Overall, I'm excited about the journey ahead and look forward to one day mastering C++, as well as other languages, in order to achieve my dream of becoming a game developer at a AAA publisher.

I set out to develop a game that would be more than just a "text input" and "text output" program, even though written in C with just prompting the user. After taking the CS50x course, I felt ready and wanted to create an experience that would immerse the player in the game's world and offer an interactive combat system. This was no easy task, and I spent countless hours refining the game's code to make it work seamlessly.

During the game's testing phase, I asked my friends for feedback to fine-tune the game's mechanics and make it as engaging as possible. This process was challenging but also highly rewarding, as it allowed me to gain insights into the player's experience and make the necessary adjustments to create a truly captivating game.

As I continued to work on the game, I realized that I needed to make it compatible with both Windows and Unix systems as some functions did not work on my friends computer. This proved to be a fascinating experience as I delved deeper into the world of programming and learned about the different systems and architectures that underpinned them, even though the output visible in my code were just a couple of lines.

Features of the game are: an interactive combat system, various riddles to solve, finding important items to proceed in the game, zombies and boss' fights and more!

All in all, this project has been a journey of discovery, learning, and creativity. It has allowed me to explore new programming concepts, push the boundaries of what is possible, and develop a game that I am truly proud of. I feel ready to start a new journey with CS50's Computer Science for Game Development.
