Create a short video (that’s no more than 3 minutes in length) in which you present your project to the world, as with slides, screenshots, voiceover, and/or live action. Your video should somehow include your project’s title, your name, your city and country, and any other details that you’d like to convey to viewers. See howtogeek.com/205742/how-to-record-your-windows-mac-linux-android-or-ios-screen for tips on how to make a “screencast,” though you’re welcome to use an actual camera. Upload your video to YouTube (or, if blocked in your country, a similar site) and take note of its URL; it’s fine to flag it as “unlisted,” but don’t flag it as “private.”

#### DESCRIPTION

As a young boy, I remember taking my first steps in programming with the help of the Commodore64 and its language Basic. The device opened up a whole new world of possibilities and I spent countless hours tinkering with it, learning about programming concepts and exploring the limits of what was possible back then.

A couple of years later I was introduced to one of my favorite video games, Resident Evil. The game captivated me with its breathtaking storyline and innovative gameplay mechanics. As I jumped deeper into the world of programming, I began to dream of creating my own game, one that would rival even the great Resident Evil (My second dream is to work for Capcom ;-).

I set out to develop a game that would be more than just a "text input" and "text output" program, even though written in C. After taking the CS50x course, I felt ready and wanted to create an experience that would immerse the player in the game's world and offer an interactive combat system. This was no easy task, and I spent countless hours refining the game's code to make it work seamlessly.

During the game's testing phase, I asked my friends for feedback to fine-tune the game's mechanics and make it as engaging as possible. This process was challenging but also highly rewarding, as it allowed me to gain insights into the player's experience and make the necessary adjustments to create a truly captivating game.

As I continued to work on the game, I realized that I needed to make it compatible with both Windows and Unix systems as some functions did not work on my friends computer. This proved to be a fascinating experience as I delved deeper into the world of programming and learned about the different systems and architectures that underpinned them, even though the output visible in my code were just a couple of lines.

All in all, this project has been a journey of discovery, learning, and creativity. It has allowed me to explore new programming concepts, push the boundaries of what is possible, and develop a game that I am truly proud of. I feel ready to start a new journey with CS50's Computer Science for Game Development.
